    shortDescription: >-
      Docker image to convert QuakeML format to NonLinLoc PHS format.
    documentation: 'https://github.com/INGV/qml2nllphs/blob/master/README.md'
    longDescription: >
      This project is developed to create a Docker image with a simple converter from QuakeML to NonLinLoc PHS.

      QuakeML is a flexible, extensible and modular XML representation of seismological data which is intended to cover a broad range of fields of application in modern seismology. More info about QuakeML: https://quake.ethz.ch/quakeml/
 
      The NonLinLoc (Non-Linear Location) package is a set of programs for velocity model construction, travel-time calculation and probabilistic, non-linear, global-search earthquake location in 3D structures, and for visualisation of 3D volume data and location results. Many of the programs operate with a 3D Grid structure which defines a specific, gridded, rectangular volume (Non-GLOBAL mode) or spherical section (GLOBAL mode).
